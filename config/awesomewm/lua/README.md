The following [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) configuration is heavily
inspired by [Garado](https://github.com/garado)'s [AwesomeWM
Dotfiles](https://github.com/garado/awesome_dotfiles)!

Make sure to check the original AwesomeWM setup out and give our fellow
Linux-Ricer a follow!

The primary goal of this setup is to create an environment that:
  1. Can be used easily on both my laptop and my touchscreen tablet
  2. Integrates all the cli tools I use to manage my life into a nice dashboard
  3. Looks Awesome!

# Dashboard
