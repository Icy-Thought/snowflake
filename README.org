* Introduction
A hamerspace containing a declarative NixOS environment consisting of many hand-crafted configurations, ranging from Alacritty, Emacs (27.2), Neovim (v0.5), Zathura to many other applications which can be found in the =./home= directory.

#+begin_quote
*WARNING*: this repository, like other dotfile/configuration repositories, is subjected to change. Thus the reader ought to read through the commit history before blindly cloning, fetching or updating the necessary files required to power up their NixOS environment.
#+end_quote

In this README I will attempt to explain how to replicate my NixOS setup or achieve similar feats. If you find this guide not as useful as it was designed to be, do submit an issue requesting a change for the specific sections you found to be confusing. /Or/ submit a push request (PR) to this repository and hopefully we can produce better results together!

Throughout my Nix journey I've came across two interesting projects and among those projects are Nix-Flakes and Home-Manager, which will be introduced later in this README. These projects have been setup in such manner that allows its users to carefully tune their system environments to their liking!

#+begin_quote
One should note that this project is still in its early stages, henceforth one should familiarize themselves with the [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager#words-of-warning][risks]] that comes with the usage of such experimental features.
#+end_quote

* Getting Started
** Partitioning & Formatting
Here I advice you to follow to carefully written [[https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation-partitioning][guide]] by the lovely NixOS members about partitions, how to setup your partitions & later format them to their desired file-systems.

** WARNING
The following guide is written with =nixos-gnome-21.05.1205.b72bde7c4a1-x86_64-linux.iso= in mind, meaning that the attempt to install your Nix-Flake system from the LiveUSB won't work. You should instead proceed with a minimal NixOS installation and later attempt to upgrade to your Nix-Flake system!

** Nix-Channels
Setup your environment ot use the bleeding edge repository of NixOS and also add Home-Manager to your nix-channels:
#+begin_src shell :noeval
sudo nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixos-unstable nixos
sudo nix-channel --update
#+end_src

* Minimal Installation Process
#+begin_quote
In =nixos-gnome-21.05.1205.b72bde7c4a1-x86_64-linux.iso= it's unfortunately not possible to setup your flake based system without having Nix fail the installation process. Thus the user ought to install a minimal setup and later switch to their flake-based system after rebooting their minimal setup.
#+end_quote

** Mount & Create Required Dirs
#+begin_src shell :noeval
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/nixos /mnt
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/boot
sudo mount /dev/disk/by-label/boot /mnt/boot
#+end_src

To prevent future crashes throughout the installation process, enable your newly created swap partition:
#+begin_src shell :noeval
sudo swapon /dev/sdX
#+end_src

** Prepare System Environment for Nix-Flake
Don't forget to append the following lines of code to your =configuration.nix=:
#+begin_src nix :noeval
nix.package = pkgs.nixUnstable;
nix.extraOptions = ''
  experimental-features = nix-command flakes
'';
#+end_src

* Nix-Flake: Beginning of a Journey
#+begin_quote
The reader should keep in mind that this guide documents how to replicate my personal setup and thus the reader ought to know that =modules/nixos/default.nix= have been specifically modified to use my system passwords. To change the hashed passwords, replace the ~users.hashedPassword~ with the ~hashedPassword~ generated through ~mkpasswd -m sha-512~.
#+end_quote

** Git Clone ~Snowflake~ && ~ln -s~ Nix-Files To Correct Dir
~git clone~ your desired repository and because this guide is written with my personal flake repository in mind:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
git clone https://github.com/Icy-Thought/Snowflake.git
#+end_src

Backup the contents of your current =/etc/nixos= directory, you'll need your auto-generated =hardware-configuration.nix= file to later input in =modules/hardware=.

I prefer to keep my configurations inside my git repository for easier management, but you are free to do whatever you deem saner in the following installation process:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
cd Snowflake
sudo ln -s flake.nix /etc/nixos
sudo ln -s flake.lock /etc/nixos
#+end_src

** Replacing Necessary Configuration Entries
*** =Hardware-Configuration.nix=
Place your newly generated =hardware-configuration.nix= inside =modules/hardware= and make sure to update the hardware entry in =flake.nix=.

#+CAPTION: Example: ~ThinkPad-E595~ defined as a valid system environment.
#+begin_src nix :noeval
nixosConfigurations = {
  thinkpad = mkNixosConfig {
    hardwareModules = [
      ./modules/hardware/ThinkPad-E595.nix
      # nixos-hardware.nixosModules.lenovo-thinkpad-e595
    ];
    extraModules = [ ./profiles/ThinkPad-E595.nix ];
  };
};
#+end_src

*** =profiles/X=
By default, Nautilus & Dolphin does not hide system partitions from mounted devices category. Since this has not been the experience I have been accustomed to, I have chosen to hide those partitions from appearing in the mounted devices category of those file managers. I have also added several kernel parameters and other specific configurations for my setup in this repository.

What you are required to edit is the ~fileSystems~ entries in =profiles/X= (where =X= stands for host machine) and also the specific parts which you wish to exclude from your setup, such as: kernel parameters, =modules/wireguard/default.nix=, packages to be installed among other home-related configurations.

#+CAPTION: Example: hiding =/boot= from Nautilus mounted devices.
#+begin_src nix :noeval
fileSystems."/boot" = {
  device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/insert-your-boot-uuid-here";
  fsType = "vfat";
  options = [ "x-gvfs-hide" ]; # For hiding boot partition entry in Nautilus.
};
#+end_src

*** Installing Nix-Flake System
After completing your setup, there remains one command to be executed (device = =nixosConfigurations.device_name= entry in =flake.nix=);
#+begin_src shell :noeval
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake '/etc/nixos#device_name --impure
reboot
#+end_src

* Doom Emacs && Neovim Nightly
** Doom Emacs
If you have replicated my setup, you need to do nothing but ~git clone~ doom-emacs repository and proceed with the installation process. If not, add the following packages to your =packages.nix=:
#+begin_src nix :noeval
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # required dependencies
  git
  emacs
  ripgrep

  # optional dependencies
  coreutils
  fd
  clang
];
#+end_src

To proceed with the installation of doom-emacs on your newly installed/configured nix-flake system:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
#+end_src

** Neovim Nightly
Neovim-nightly attempts to bring forward a new configuration solution to the world of Vim and since this repository is lua-based ([[https://github.com/siduck76/NvChad][siduck76]] + custom modifications) it is required from the user to install =packer.nvim=, compile and sync Neovim-nightly:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
git clone https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
#+end_src

Enter neovim environment and execute the following commands:
#+begin_src sh :noeval
:PackerCompile
:PackerSync
#+end_src

Restart your neovim environment and you should be greeted with your newly configured neovim setup!

* Congratulations! 🎉
You have successful installed your/my personally hand-crafted/replicated Nix-Flake environment. I hope it suits your needs, if not then you are always welcome to propose changes or fork the project and customize the repository to your heart's content!
